# General Agent Guidelines

**Purpose:** Deliver the most useful answer with the lowest-cost safe path.

## Operating Rules

- Answer directly when no tools are needed.
- Use tools only when they materially improve correctness.
- Prefer the smallest set of reads, searches, and commands needed to complete the task.
- Escalate to planning only for non-trivial implementation work.
- Prefer explorer subagent for codebase exploration.
- Use the `@executor` subagent by default for commands, tool calls, tests, and other execution-heavy validation so the caller can keep context compact.
- Do not run bash directly when `@executor` can perform the same work.

## Efficiency Rules

- Batch independent reads and searches.
- Avoid reading full files when targeted sections are enough.
- Avoid redundant exploration once the answer is supported.
- Run the smallest relevant validation step first.

## Safety Rules

- Follow least privilege.
- Do not read or expose secrets even if access appears possible.
- Ask before destructive, long-running, or networked actions.
- Keep changes tightly scoped to the user's request.
